# SQL Practice Exercises

This repository contains a collection of SQL practice exercises focused on various aspects of database management. These exercises cover a wide range of SQL commands, including queries, updates, insertions, and deletions. The exercises are designed to improve SQL skills and provide practical examples of common database operations.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **sql_practices.sql**: This file contains all the SQL commands used during the practice sessions, including exercises on querying data, filtering results, updating records, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Topics Covered

### **Basic SQL Queries**
- **Retrieve all records**: Selecting all records from the `kitaplar` table.
- **Select specific columns**: Selecting specific columns from the `yazarlar` table.

### **Filtering Data**
- **Filter by specific values**: Using `WHERE` to filter records based on specific criteria (e.g., finding authors named "Orhan").
- **Using `DISTINCT`**: Listing unique author names.
- **Pattern matching with `LIKE`**: Finding authors whose names start with certain letters.

### **Logical Operators**
- **Using `AND`, `OR`**: Combining multiple conditions to filter data, such as finding books published in a specific year and priced at a certain amount.

### **Sorting and Limiting Results**
- **Order by specific columns**: Sorting results based on price, page count, or author names.
- **Limit results**: Retrieving the top N records from the table.

### **Aggregate Functions**
- **Find the youngest/oldest author**: Using `MIN` and `MAX` to find extreme values.
- **Calculate totals**: Using functions like `SUM`, `AVG` for aggregation.

### **Inserting and Updating Data**
- **Insert new records**: Adding new authors to the `yazarlar` table.
- **Bulk insertions**: Inserting multiple records in a single query.
- **Update specific fields**: Updating hints in the `demo` table based on certain conditions.

### **Deleting Data**
- **Delete specific records**: Removing records based on their ID or other criteria.
